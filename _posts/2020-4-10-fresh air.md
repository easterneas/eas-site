**AFTER 12 YEARS** of busy things happen in my life since I had sl4y-it.co.cc site before (it's not working anymore), finally I can get in touch of reviving my blog once again.

So... hi again! And I should re-introduce myself again, as it has been vacuum for so long of no blogging sessions.

I'm Eas, the self-taught web developer, also a small YouTuber (more on that later). And this is where I dump my knowledge: web development stuffs like PHP development and its derivatives; experiment about new ways of developing web such as Jekyll (actually this is cool!); and other things computer and networking basics.

Man... I couldn't stop thinking that this is gonna be the most efficient way of blogging (no WYSIWYG-thingy), when comparing to my blog in the past using WordPress. Templates? I can make it using just a normal HTML and Liquid tag.

Well, I can use PHP to make the same, though, but for just the blogging site, it's too complex and has more points of issues/failure. So, using static site generator like Jekyll, [provides more benefits for me on blogging](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/why-use-a-static-site-generator/).

Ah, yes, back to topic.

As I mentioned earlier, I will share my knowledge here, so everyone can benefit of my way of learning things. And speaking of sharing knowledge, I also have [Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/Eas.EasyAndSimple/) and also a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwW62q1NEy-jq2_RkjegoAQ), so go check them out. My YouTube channel will be mostly in Indonesian, and it's more of a computing knowledge, rather than about software development.

Well, I guess this will be the new beginning. In the midst of COVID-19 pandemic as of this writing, I happened to learn something new as I couldn't go outside my house. So, yeah... my blog is born (again), and that's it! I'll keep my blog posted every time I have a new idea when I develop something new, so stay tuned, and keep it [easy and simple](https://eas.web.id)!
